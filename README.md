# Database-Access-Control-Matrix
The implemented access control matrix is a hybrid between the Role-Based Access Control and Discretionary Access Control to accept/reject user commands before they reach an SQL server. This is an RBAC model because a given user’s role determines what type of SQL queries and system commands that a user can perform. For example, a regular user can only perform read/write/delete for a given table. A security officer can only perform commit/rollback. An admin can perform all the above and create/drop tables and users. Additionally, they can grant and revoke and transfer if they have control or ownership. This ACM is also a DAC model because the RBAC model sets what a user is maximally allowed to do; however, most users typically start with no rights (except for owners). Rights must be granted, or ownership transferred in order to distribute these rights to other users. This is accomplished via a custom class called a CommandPair. This pair contains if the right is allowed (based on the role), if the right is currently active for a given user, and if the right is transferable to another user (copy flag). The system checks this pairing accordingly.

# DOCMENTATION
-	Launch- Instantiates an ACM and performs a series of function testing.
-	SubjectCommand- Keeps track of subject ownership and control.
-	ObjectCommand- Keeps track of object ownership, control, insert/select/delete commands, along with revoke and ownership transfer functions.
    -	RevokeAll- can revoke a given command (insert/select/delete)
     -	RevokeSelect- can revoke select
     -	RevokeInsert- can revoke insert
     -	RevokeDelete- can revoke delete
     -	RemoveOwner- removes ownership
     -	MakeOwner- makes owner of object
     -	SetCurrentAndTransferable- Helper function to make all commands (insert/select/delete) currently active and transferable
     -	PrintCommands- Helper function for printing the ACM
-	Subject- Keeps track of subject name, password, role, and subject and object command listing.
-	Role- Enumeration of possible roles- Regular User, Security Officer, Admin, Root
-	Object- Keeps track of object name and owner
-	Commands- Enumeration of object (table) commands- Select, Insert, Delete
-	CommandPair- Keeps track of a given command to see if it is allowed (based on user role), if it is currently active, and if it is transferable to another subject.
-	ACM- System to keep track of subjects and objects and to accept/reject commands from users before they effect the database.
